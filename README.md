# QAware
Visualization for awareness on sleepy drivers.


To run this game, please run python3 main.py

# Description

This project QAware is an AI/ML recognition simulation software to detect sleepy drivers and pull them to safety. To show this, we created a UI game for drivers to move around while we monitor the eye awareness level on the driver. Using OpenCV and facial recognition, we use these algorithms to detect if their eyes fall underneath a certain threshold to take ahold of their car and pull them over. Check out our demo to visually see how this works!
